- 👋 Hi, I’m @TDLemonNovecento
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and its prerequisites!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL and want to write my own cookbook application to store my recipes in a less messy way
      than with 15 books and folders accross the kitchen
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really! I've only worked alone on projects so far so I'd love to work in a group for a change :)
- 📫 How to reach me: overleaf_stu@gmx.net
